 //// BASIC INFORMATION ////
 -This is a basic outline for a website
 -security needs to be worked on
 -logging is still pretty buggy
 -working database

 ** I decided to quite working on this because I wanted my portfolio to use react.js instead of templating handlebars.
 ** This code is also kind of old and messy, one days ill come clean it up.
